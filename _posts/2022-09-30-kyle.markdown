SpeakQL2 builds upon prior work done within the ADALab on a speech + touch SQL query interface designed to enable effective SQL querying against databases using mobile devices. SpeakQL2 introduces a new dialect of SQL designed to make the speech dictation process more natural. In this presentation, we discuss the objectives of the language, language features, implementation details, and an ongoing usability study that we are conducting to evaluate various features of the new dialect.
