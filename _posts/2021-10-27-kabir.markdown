Recent advances in deep learning (DL) architectures have improved model quality in a variety of domains, but have come at the expense of a substantial increase in model sizes. Model architectures have reached unprecedented scales, and multi-billion parameter models have become commonplace.

Unfortunately, GPU memory capacity growth has not kept pace with this rapid expansion, introducing a new systems bottleneck for DL users. While solutions exist, such as model parallelism, they suffer from performance drawbacks and introduce efficiency issues of their own.

In this talk, I will introduce Hydra, our new system for large-scale multi-model training. Hydra takes a fresh database-inspired approach to the problem, introducing new ML systems techniques adapted from RDBMSs. This includes a highly general form of automatic model sharding and spilling across memory hierarchy, a novel hybrid of model parallelism and task parallelism inspired by multi-query optimization, and a new paired scheduling scheme inspired by double buffering in RDBMSs.

Our system demonstrates linear speedups against model parallelism and 50% faster training times versus state-of-the-art pipeline parallel techniques. To explore Hydra's real-world usability, we are currently working with a group training deep learning models for physics, where high-resolution data poses challenges for scalability.
