title:  "Accelerating Analytic Queries on Oracle In-Memory Database"
date:   2021-10-18

Oracle In-Memory database was first released in 2014, with its unique dual-format architecture, Oracle Database In-Memory transparently accelerates analytics queries by orders of magnitude, and enables HTAP for real time decision making. On columnar data, the scan could be blazingly fast, however the challenge remains on improving important higher level SQL operators such as joins and aggregation performance. In this talk, I will first introduce Oracle Database In-Memory architecture, then I will present various work we have made as well as ongoing work on accelerating In-Memory analytic queries, such as novel data structures and algorithms design, query execution engine re-design, and modern hardware acceleration.
